### Final coursework for the module Simulation Modeling from the MSc in Artificial Intelligence.
# The intricacies of group projects

Free riding at group coursework is a common
practice in a university setting. It can be analysed from a game-
theoretical perspective as a variant of the prisoner dilemma,
with the difference that encounters do not happen between two
individuals, but a group of them. This paper proposes a simple
model that characterised the group coursework problem and
deduces the behaviour of the system by three different methods,
namely an analytical integration, a numerical integration, and
an agent-based model. By an analysis of the results, the system
shows a sigmoid-like behaviour ending up in one of two polarized
modes: everybody cooperates or everybody defects, depending
on the model parameters. Finally, a more complex model with
a network topology is proposed and simulated, showing possible
equilibriums at mixed states in the population.
